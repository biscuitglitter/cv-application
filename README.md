this is a react-based cv builder app.

the app supports the creation of a CV with a section to add general information, and a section to add job experience. 
A task can hold a name, date, parent project, and priority.

*project reflections* <br>
i started this project with a slightly different approach than with my javascript learning. with javascript, i always skipped some parts of projects when i felt like i was really, really stuck.. and that process of not taking risks didn't help because i never felt fully satisfied, so this time i persisted. <br>
i struggled a lot every step of the way because react is still so new to me, but i worked hard and managed to figure all of it out and do what i needed get done, so im happy.
excuse the very simple styling, i want to move forward with my react learning.
