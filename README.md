this is a react-based cv application app.

the app supports the creation of a CV with a section to add general information, and a section to add job experience. 

*project reflections* <br>
i started this react project with a slightly different approach than the one i had with my javascript-only ones. with js, i always skipped some parts of projects when i felt like i was really, really stuck.. and that process of not diving deep enough didn't help because i never felt fully satisfied after finishing a project, so this time i persisted. <br>
i struggled a lot every step of the way because react is still so _new_ to me, but i worked hard and managed to figure it all out and do what i needed to do, so im happy.
